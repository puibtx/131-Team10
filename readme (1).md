## :deciduous_tree:	Introduction 

Team 10 has be assigned a project to develop a blogging application with four given set functional requirements. More functional requirements are to be implemented into the application with four other non-functional requirements. The main programming language that will be used in the project will be `python` with `flask`. The team meetings will be prompted and noted down at our [meetings.md](https://github.com/puibtx/131-Team10/blob/master/meetings.md).

## :balance_scale: Ethical Implication

The team’s main responsibility in developing the web application is to respect all of whom may use the application. The team will strive for confidentiality and anonymity within the application. This means that all and any identifying information will not be accessed by anyone other than the application developers. Users' identities will always be unknown and the team must ensure that user data is secured. The web application should work for everyone using google chrome with no issues. Our team’s application shall be built on a continuous improvement system foundation in order to keep pushing for refinement.

An engineering solution is a process that spells out the solution requirements to satisfy the conditions or constraints of the solution. In other words, engineers will always do a vast amount of research in order to obtain the greatest results. Although engineering solutions have made a great positive impact on the world in regards to humanities’ improvement, there are still negativities that need to be addressed. Engineers have made home life a much more livable and comfortable place with home appliances, air conditioning, better home insulation, purified water, etc. Other than homes, engineers have improved and developed physical infrastructures like transportation systems, communication networks, sewage, water, and school systems, etc. Humanity’s life improvement does come with a cost. Engineering solutions also gave birth to weapons of mass destruction that leveled cities and of course, killed people. Manufacturing these weapons or any other type of product also takes a toll on the environment as well. These factories and other factors have caused all types of pollution that will likely keep affecting the environment in a negative way. This type of condition will be the toughest to address but there are countless engineers willing to solve this issue using engineering solutions.

| 5   | User Home Page                  |            
| 6   | Update User Information         |          
| 7   | Post Pictures / Text            |         
| 8   | Like / Dislike Posts            |           
| 9   | Delete Posts                    |         
| 10  | Follow Users                    |         
| 11  | Display Other Users' Profiles   |         
| 12  | Search Users                    |   

The functional requiremnets are as listed above and use cases are provided through our [requirements.md](https://github.com/puibtx/131-Team10/blob/master/requirements.md).

| **Non-Functional Requirements**                                 | 
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Works on Google Chrome                                          |     
| Consistent Font Throughout Site                                 |    
| Text Length Constraint of no more than 250 Characters for Posts |      
| Using Elements from `Bootstraps`                                | 

The non-functional requirements are as listed above. Our team wants to ensure that the application will work on Google Chrome without any issues. The font size, color, and type will be consistent throughout the whole webpage. When creating a new post, a text box will appear and will remind the user about the text length constraint. The text length constraint will be 250 characters for posts. Last non-functional requirement is that the webpage will use elements from `Bootstraps`.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

## :rocket:	How to Use

- [Running the Program]()
- [Signing Up]()
- [Creating an Account]()
- [Navigation Bar]()

### Running the Program
To start up the web application, the user will need to be in the directory where **main.py** is located. They will then use the python command below to run the program.
```
$python3 main.py

```
### Signing Up
Once the user has the web application running, the log in page will be the first page they will be in. The user is able to type into the `email` text box and `password` text box to enter their information if they have an account already. Once the text boxes are filled with the correct information, the user may click on the `Sign In` button and will be redirected to the user home page.

### Creating an Account
If the user does not have an account in the system, the user is able to click the `Sign Up` button located in the bottom. The user will be redirected to the create account page. The user is able to enter in their preferred username, email, and password. Once the user is done implementing the information, they may click `create account`. They are then redirected again to the login page where they can enter their credeentials and click `Sign In` to be redirected to the user home page.

### Navigation Bar
Once the user is in the user home page, they will see a navigation bar located at the top of the website. This navigation bar will be the main tool that the user will use to go around and navigate around the website.
