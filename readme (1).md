## Introduction
The team’s main responsibility in developing the web application is to respect all of whom may use the application. The team will strive for confidentiality and anonymity within the application. This means that all and any identifying information will not be accessed by anyone other than the application developers. Users' identities will always be unknown and the team must ensure that user data is secured. The web application should work for everyone using google chrome with no issues. Our team’s application shall be built on a continuous improvement system foundation in order to keep pushing for refinement.

An engineering solution is a process that spells out the solution requirements to satisfy the conditions or constraints of the solution. In other words, engineers will always do a vast amount of research in order to obtain the greatest results. Although engineering solutions have made a great positive impact on the world in regards to humanities’ improvement, there are still negativities that need to be addressed. Engineers have made home life a much more livable and comfortable place with home appliances, air conditioning, better home insulation, purified water, etc. Other than homes, engineers have improved and developed physical infrastructures like transportation systems, communication networks, sewage, water, and school systems, etc. Humanity’s life improvement does come with a cost. Engineering solutions also gave birth to weapons of mass destruction that leveled cities and of course, killed people. Manufacturing these weapons or any other type of product also takes a toll on the environment as well. These factories and other factors have caused all types of pollution that will likely keep affecting the environment in a negative way. This type of condition will be the toughest to address but there are countless engineers willing to solve this issue using engineering solutions.
